# Multimodal-drug-discovery

Project by OpenBioML community to learn multi modal representation learning from structure and other modalities (images,text, ..).


##Image-structure dataset

A dataset of 30K compound and ~1M images is available here https://github.com/gigascience/paper-bray2017.
Quite messy to dowload everything with the metadata, also need to remove DMSO (no compound), they did those kind of things in https://openreview.net/pdf?id=OdXKRtg1OG
but did not release their code or dataset yet (will be updated on https://github.com/ml-jku/cloome).

There is a subset of this dataset containing 10.5K compound with their associated images and could be a way to start since it is quite easy to download and the metadata
are also easily available at https://github.com/ml-jku/hti-cnn with the metadata in datasplit.
